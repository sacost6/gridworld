# Project Summary
For this program, we were required to create a data structure to represent a country or world populated by people which kept track of every person in so-called district. The time requirement was that all run-times of functions must be O(1)

# Some Requirements:
* Design a data structure to represent the world divided into districts that will be able to meet the run-time requirements on all functions that are written
* Write a function that will represent the birth of a person and write a function that will represent the death of a person
* Write a function that will simulate a person moving from one district to another
* Give every person an ID number and recycle the ID numbers when a person is dead (no longer using the ID)
* Keep count of total population and district populations
